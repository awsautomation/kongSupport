   KONG Enterprise Terraform Module -  EC2 is not having any Kong Configurations files or setUp
   
   Kong Enterprise Terraform Module has been installed successfully on AWS and for verfying the configuartions i have attached the public IP to one of the Instance whcih has been created by running the Kong Enterprise Terraform code. But once i have login to that Ubuntu Machine (EC2) for verifying Kong configurations i could not see any setup and Kong configurations file.
   
   We have followed the Standard Kong Enterprise Terraform Module code to install the Kong using Terraform. Please lets us know the Root casue or issue why so it's has not installed any Kong Configuartions file EC2 machine.
